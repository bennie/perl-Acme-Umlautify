Revision history for Perl extension Acme::Umlautify.

VERSIONTAG  DATETAG

	Moving to UTF (as opposed to Latin-1) thanks to an emailed suggestion
		by Jeremy Mates <jmates@uw.edu> - this literally allows the
		addition of umlatus to everything, including spaces.

	Almost concurrently, Nick Wellnhofer <nwellnhof@cpan.org> opened 
		RT #93530 which suggested a UTF solution to the lack of
		umlauts for Latin lower-case y.
